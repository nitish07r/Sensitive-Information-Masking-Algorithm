# Sensitive-Information-Masking-Algorithm
Our project introduces a novel approach to privacy-preserving sensitive information 
masking, departing from conventional deletion practices by integrating data aggregation 
techniques with innovative strategies focused on enhancing privacy and utility. While 
drawing inspiration from evolutionary optimization methods such as Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, Grey Wolf 
Optimization, and Honey Bee Optimization, our approach innovatively focuses on adding 
artificial data to decrease the frequency of sensitive information rather than deleting it. This 
unique strategy ensures improved privacy protection while enhancing data utility. 
Additionally, our methodology emphasizes real-time data transformation techniques to 
ensure privacy without compromising utility. Moreover, our project stands out for its 
practical applicability, offering secure data transformation algorithms for collaboration 
with third parties, thus bridging the gap between privacy preservation and real-world 
impact. Key aspects of our project's novelty include: 

● Integration of data aggregation techniques instead of data deletion with innovative 
strategies for privacy preservation and utility enhancement 
● Emphasis on adding artificial data to decrease the frequency of sensitive 
information and pattern that need to be hidden. 
● Real-time data transformation techniques for privacy preservation 
● Practical applicability through secure data transformation algorithms for 
collaboration with third parties 
● Delicate balance between privacy preservation and data utility
